# Luna

Luna is an experiment in writing a Scheme-derived programming language for
teaching myself about programming language theory, design, and implementation.

## Building

Luna is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and hence it uses Cargo as
its build system. Once a Rust distribution is installed, Luna can be built with
the `cargo build` command, and run with the `cargo run` command. To build with
release optimisations enabled, pass the `--release` flag to either command.
